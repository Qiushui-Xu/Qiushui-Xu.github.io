I am an incoming fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Penn State University, advised by [Prof. Necdet Serhat Aybat](https://nsaybat.org/). Before joining Penn State University, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Lanzhou University. I also have wonderful exchange experiences at UC-Berkeley and University of Wisconsin–Madison. 

My research interests include **large language models**, **reinforcement learning**, **convex optimization** and **non-linear optimization**.

## News
- [May 2025] I joined X, The Moonshot Factory (Formerly Google X Lab) as an AI Resident in May 2025, working on [Tapestry](https://x.company/projects/tapestry/) project utilizing the power of LLMs and RL.
- [May 2025] Our paper *Unveiling Markov heads in Pretrained Language Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning* is accepted by **ICML** 2025.
- [May 2024] I joined Microsoft Research as a Research Intern, working on in-context learning and offline reinforcement learning.
