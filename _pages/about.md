I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Penn State University, advised by Prof. Necdet Serhat Aybat. Before joining Penn State University, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Lanzhou University. I also have wonderful exchange experiences at UC-Berkeley and University of Wisconsin–Madison. My research interests include convex optimization and non-linear optimization.
