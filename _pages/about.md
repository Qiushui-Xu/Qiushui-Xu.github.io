I am a forth-year Ph.D. candidate at Penn State University, advised by [Prof. Necdet Serhat Aybat](https://nsaybat.org/). Before joining Penn State University, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Lanzhou University. I also have wonderful exchange experiences at UC-Berkeley and University of Wisconsin–Madison. 

My research interests include **reinforcement learning**, **convex optimization** and **non-linear optimization**.
